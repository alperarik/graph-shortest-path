# graph shortest path
Creates random graph

Finds minumum spanning tree with Kruskal algorithm

Calculates shortest path between source to destination with A* algorithm

##

Project uses swing GUI

GUI console shows : 

- All distances on MST, 

- A* processing time, 

- Path, 

- Count of dequeue 

- Remaining queue values,

- Maximum reached queue size while calculation
